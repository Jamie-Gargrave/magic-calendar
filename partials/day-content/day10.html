      <h5>History of Human Rights Day</h5>
      <p>Human Rights Day marks the anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in
        1948. The significance of this day was highlighted by the issuance of a commemorative stamp by the United
        Nations Postal Administration in 1952, which received over 200,000 advance orders. The Declaration aims to
        establish a universal standard of living that every individual is entitled to, encouraging all UN member
        states to strive towards this ideal. Although these rights are not legally binding, they have significantly
        influenced global perceptions of human rights and have been a force for positive change.</p>

        theme in 2014, while "Stand up for someone’s rights today" was highlighted in 2016. This day serves as a
        reminder to embrace equality and acknowledge our shared humanity.</p>
