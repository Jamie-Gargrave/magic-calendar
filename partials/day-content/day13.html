      <p>National Cocoa Day, celebrated on December 13, is a delightful occasion dedicated to enjoying the rich and
        comforting flavours of cocoa. This day invites everyone to indulge in a warm cup of cocoa, whether it's the
        classic hot cocoa made with cocoa powder or the luxurious hot chocolate crafted from ground chocolate, making
        it a perfect time to explore various recipes and toppings.</p>

      <h5>History of National Cocoa Day</h5>
      <p>Cocoa has a fascinating history that dates back over 5,000 years. Originally enjoyed as a bitter beverage by
        ancient Mesoamerican cultures, it was flavoured with vanilla and chilli rather than sugar. European explorers
        discovered cocoa in South America and initially found its taste unappealing, but it later became a luxury
        drink sweetened for the wealthy. The invention of powdered chocolate in 1828 paved the way for the chocolate
        bar and instant hot cocoa we know today.</p>

      <h5>How to Celebrate National Cocoa Day</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Drink Cocoa: No celebration is complete without a steaming cup of cocoa! Make your favourite version and
          perhaps organise a recipe swap with friends during your tea break.</li>
        <li>Try Hot Cocoa Bombs: For those feeling adventurous, why not make hot cocoa bombs? These chocolate spheres
          filled with cocoa and marshmallows create a fun and unique way to enjoy your drink.</li>
        <li>Experiment with Toppings: Elevate your hot cocoa by trying different toppings like marshmallows, candy
          canes, or caramel. For a twist, consider adding spices such as cinnamon or nutmeg for extra flavour.</li>
      </ul>
